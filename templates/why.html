		<h2 style="color: #fff;">What is Minecraftly?</h2>
		<p style="color: #fff;">Minecraftly is a shared distributed Minecraft game server that provides persistent world among multiple, autoscaled cloud instances.</p>
		<p style="color: #fff;">Our servers and storage automatically scale in real time to current workload and can be accessed from all of our machines around the world. There is no setup, no skill required to run and maintain. You only need two things:</p>
		<p style="color: #fff;"><i class="mc mc-apple"></i> Minecraft game client software running on your computer.</p>
		<p style="color: #fff;"><i class="mc mc-apple"></i> Minecraft account.</p>

	<div flex="100" ng-style="{'padding': '10vw'}">
		<h2 style="color: #fff;">How it works</h2>
		<p style="color: #fff;">Our software runs on our cluster of machines and talks directly to our cloud infrastructure. You don't need to run or maintain any servers or pay for hosting.</p>
		<p style="color: #fff;">To get started, use your <b>Minecraft username</b>, add <b>m.ly</b> to the end of your username. Voila! Your Minecraft world server is now <b>username.m.ly</b></p>
		<p style="color: #fff;">For example: if my username is Notch, the server is at Notch.m.ly</p>
		<p style="color: #fff;"><i class="mc mc-egg"></i> TIP: If you don't need a custom username, simply connect to <b>m.ly</b>, it will bring you to the same server.</p>
		<p style="color: #fff;">The world loading speed is better than SSD, and similar to RAM disk. We use workload adaptive heuristics such as real time compression, write bundling and read caching to implement high performance.</p>
